## Result

All the answers are attached in the Survey answers section, they were collected in May 2014 from 65
of my Facebook friends. The survey was anonymous.

### Summary

A majority of participants(78%) do not use any tool to remember their passwords, 55% do **not** use
secure passwords in general, and 57% find it difficult to keep track of their passwords. How many
accounts the participants had was very spread out, except that very few (only one) had less than 6
accounts.

Some people who use OAuth like it because it's easier or quicker, while other are sceptical about
the security, or feel like they are giving up too much information.

Multiple participants have commented that they use secure passwords only for the accounts they think
are important, and use less secure ones on other accounts.
