## Discussion

A surprisingly large portion of participants remember all of their passwords manually, I would have
expected more people to use password managers or even pen and paper (which was sadly not an explicit
alternative to the question) to remember their passwords.

Even though 78% remember their passwords by heart, only 43% find it difficult to keep track of them.
It would be interesting to see what the reason for this gap is, if it is because they use the same
password for many things, that they just have a very good memory, that they are using some kind of
system to memorize them, or perhaps using real phrases as passwords.

More than half of the participants do **not** use secure passwords, this sounds very worrying to me.
That said, the specified definition of "generally using secure passwords" was very strictly
formulated in the question, which may have led to this number being higher than it should be.
Perhaps this question should have had more alternatives, or even have been divided into multiple
questions.

### Further studies

I'm not completely happy with the questions that I used in the survey, if I were to do it again I
would probably add "I don't know" as an option to some of the questions, and perhaps added a "I
write them down on paper" answer to the "How do you keep track of your passwords?" question.

The question I regret not adding the most is "How many different passwords do you use?". It would
have given a much better picture of the gap between how many accounts people have and how many of
them share the same passwords.

It would of course be nice to have a much larger number of participants to get better statistical
results, but it was not possible in the very limited time that this paper was written in.
