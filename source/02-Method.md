## Method

I've decided to use a survey to broadly investigate how people manage passwords and how they feel
about doing so. I've distributed the survey through Facebook to yield a somewhat statistically
significant number of responses in a short period of time. The questions that the survey consists of
are shown below.

## Survey questions

### Which type of computer user are you?

- Basic (non technicals, Facebooking, emailing, looking up stuff, etc...)
- Competent (simple computer related work, Word, Excel, basic image editing etc.)
- Advanced (hobbyists, gamers, general computer savvy people, etc.)
- Expert (programmers, hard core geeks, IT professionals etc.)

### Approximately how many password protected accounts do you have?

> Facebook, GMail, Twitter, etc...

- 1 - 5
- 6 - 10
- 11 - 20
- 21 - 50
- More than 50

### Do you generally use secure passwords?

> Answer "No" if you use the same passwords on multiple accounts, or if they are usually
> shorter than 8 characters. Answer "Yes" if you use unique, strong passwords on all or most of
> your accounts.

- No
- Yes

### How do you keep track of your passwords?

- I don't
- I remember them all in my head
- I use a password manager
- Other (text)

### Do you find it difficult to keep track of all your passwords?

- Yes
- No

### Do you use OAuth?

- Yes
- No

### If yes, do you prefer using it over passwords? Why?

- (text)

### Other relevant opinions

## Method discussion

### Advantages

Distributing an online survey via Facebook was a very simple and pain free process that yielded
empirical, real world data quickly. I made sure that the survey was quick to finish and anonymous
so that users would not be discouraged from participating. I also gave the participants a couple of
optional text fields where they could express their opinions more freely. The text fields may
indicate some common behavior that was not directly part of the survey, and can lead to further research.

### Disadvantages

Since this was an anonymous participants has little to no incentive to answer honestly, and it is
not unlikely that participants answer some questions in a way that pleases their self image even if
it is anonymous.

It was also possible to go through the form multiple times. That said, there is no gain in doing
this other than pure spite, and as I've been following along with the rate responses have been
coming in I have seen nothing that would indicate this, hence I'm going to assume that the answers I
have received are valid.
