## Method

I've decided to use a survey to broadly investigate how people manage passwords and how they feel
about doing so. I've chosen to distribute the survey through Facebook to hopefully yield a somewhat
statistically significant number of responses in a short period of time. The questions that the
survey consists of are in an attachment.

I chose to do a survey because it will give a broad sense of the opinions of ordinary people. I will
be using a Google Drive form to collect answers, as this easily gives you a URL to the form that can
be distributed, but also makes it possible to export the data as CSV or view it in spreadsheets.

## Method discussion

### Advantages

Distributing an online survey via Facebook is a very simple and pain free process that can yield
empirical, real world data quickly. I tried to make sure that the survey was quick to finish and
anonymous so that users would not be discouraged from participating. I also give the participants a
couple of optional text fields where they could express their opinions more freely. The text fields
may indicate some common behavior that was not directly part of the survey, and can lead to further
research.

I personally believe that my Facebook friends are pretty diverse, but I have also let the
participants place themselves in a category based on their level of computer skills. This might show
differences between more experienced computer users who likely have more accounts, and less
experienced users who might not know about the tools that exist to simplify password management.

### Disadvantages

Since this was an anonymous survey, participants has little to no incentive to answer honestly, and
it is not unlikely that participants answer some questions in a way that pleases their self image
even if it is anonymous.

It was also possible to go through the form multiple times. That said, there is no gain in doing
this other than pure spite, and as I've been following along with the rate responses have been
coming in I have seen nothing that would indicate this, hence I'm going to assume that the answers I
have received are valid.
