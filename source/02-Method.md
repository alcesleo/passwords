## Method

I've decided to use a survey to broadly investigate how people manage passwords and how they feel
about doing so. I've distributed the survey through Facebook to yield a somewhat statistically
significant number of responses in a short period of time.

## Survey questions

### Which type of computer user are you?

- Basic (non technicals, Facebooking, emailing, looking up stuff, etc...)
- Competent (simple computer related work, Word, Excel, basic image editing etc.)
- Advanced (hobbyists, gamers, general computer savvy people, etc.)
- Expert (programmers, hard core geeks, IT professionals etc.)

### Approximately how many password protected accounts do you have?

> Facebook, GMail, Twitter, etc...

- 1 - 5
- 6 - 10
- 11 - 20
- 21 - 50
- More than 50

### Do you generally use secure passwords?

> Answer "No" if you use the same passwords on multiple accounts, or if they are usually
> shorter than 8 characters. Answer "Yes" if you use unique, strong passwords on all or most of
> your accounts.

- No
- Yes

### How do you keep track of your passwords?

- I don't
- I remember them all in my head
- I use a password manager
- Other (text)

### Do you find it difficult to keep track of all your passwords?

- Yes
- No

### Do you use OAuth?

> "Log in with Facebook/Twitter" and similar

- Yes
- No

### If yes, do you prefer using it over passwords? Why?

- (text)

### Other relevant opinions

## Method discussion

The advantages to this method is that I get real world data, and since the purpose was to sample how
people generally feel about passwords I believe that distributing it over Facebook sufficient
considering the time frame. I also asked the participants to categorize themselves according to
computer proficiency, this is so that if my Facebook friends tend to be more computer savvy people
than usual, it will at least show up in the statistics.
