## Abstract

This paper tries to take a critical view of whether passwords are still the most suited form of
authentication for websites. A small survey has shown that most people do not use any tool other
than their brain to remember passwords, and that more than half of the participants find it
hard to keep track of their passwords, and do not always use secure passwords.

It is no longer *needed* to use passwords as an authentication system for most web platforms, but it
is often used anyway, resulting in some unnecessary pain for users.

Further studies may include investigating how current alternatives to passwords measure up, and
perhaps if we need to invent a better system altogether.
