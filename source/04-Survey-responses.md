### Text questions

**If yes, do you prefer using it over passwords? Why?**

- Easier to use
- I am lazy.
- I don't have to remember my password.
- No, I feel like I'm giving away too much information.
- easy
- no. I only use it with a fake account for accounts I don't consider important. I wouldn't want my personal information to be linked w/ my facebook or such.
- No.  It's easier but not safe!
- Quicker and easier then looking up my password
- You don't have to remember which password you use for that specific site
- Prefer seamless browsing with as few logins as possible - for unimportant services.
- Känns inte säkert att använda en annan profil till en hemsida som man kan göra en profil på själv.
- easier to access, integrity gets worse
- No just easy
- Nope, have to use it for some schoolrelated things though
- I need to remember less passwords.
- Det är lättare.

**Other relevant opinions**

- I use insecure passwords for pages I don't consider important, and secure ones on accounts that are (e.g. related to money or similar)
- I only use unique strong passwords on accounts I care about
- I find last pass to be very convenient, but i don't use it on all my machines and therefore need to memorize my passwords anyway.
- Trash accounts have low security passwords, important ones strong randomly generated passwords
- hönökakapizza, gissa vem ;)
